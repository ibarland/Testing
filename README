A series of test-commits to see how git works (and how its svn interface works).

Workflow: 
If you want to keep a centralized repo that everybody pushes/pulls, then git
is like svn but with one extra step: after commit, you push.

  - git pull       ; cvs update
  - [make edits]
  - git update     ; cvs update
  - git commit -a -m msg     ; cvs commit
  - git push       ; pushes from local repo to the central repo.

(That's because all repos are equal; when you commit you are committing to
your local repo.  While others could pull from *your* repo, more likely
you'll want to push the changes in your repo to the centralized repo.
The advantage this has is that when you're off-line, you can still do
full commits.)

WHen using the svn interface: commits *do* get checked in, but git doesn't always display the info: the web page doesn't mention the most recent version/commit, and even 'svn up' right after 'svn commit' acts like its getting changes (even though it's not?? -- maybe only admin files are changed)
